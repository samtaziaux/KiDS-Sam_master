====================================

The KiDS Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing Pipeline, ``kids_ggl``, is meant to be the one tool to get you going with your galaxy-galaxy lensing 
measurements and interpretation using KiDS data. (Actually, the halo model can be used for any dataset, provided that the data are 
formatted in a compliant way.)
