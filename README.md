# KiDS-GGL
Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing pipeline production

*This Readme contains all the instructions needed to install, set up and run
the KiDS galaxy-galaxy lensing pipeline, which takes current KiDS and GAMA
catalogs and produces (or reads) an ESD and a covariance matrix and runs a
fitting module (i.e., halo model) with a given sampling technique.*

####1. Installation
    
    
**a)** Contact Crist贸bal Sif贸n (sifon@strw.leidenuniv.nl) to become a member
       of the KiDS-WL repository and join the KiDS-GGL team

**b)** Download [the latest stable version of the KiDS-GGL pipeline](https://github.com/KiDS-WL/KiDS-GGL/releases/latest) and unpack,

       cd path/to/kids_ggl_folder
       tar xvf KiDS-GGL-<version>.tar.gz

or, if you chose to download the `.zip` file,

        unzip KiDS-GGL-<version>.zip

where for instance `<version>=1.0.0`.

**c)** From within the same folder, run

        python setup.py install

If you don't have administrator privileges, or simply want to install it in a non-standard place (e.g., your home directory), then type

        python setup.py install --prefix=path/to/installation/
    
or
    
        python setup.py install --user

Either of these will install some additional packages required by the pipeline: `astropy>=1.1.0` for astronomical utilities (e.g., constants and units), `emcee>=2.1.0` for MCMC, `hmf==1.7.0` for halo mass function utilities, `mpmath>=0.19` for mathematical utilities, and `numpy>=1.5.0`. Optionally, if you want to use the CAMB transfer functions in your halo models (preffered method), you should also instal pycamb with CAMB version from March 2013, using the following command: 

        CAMBURL=http://camb.info/CAMB_Mar13.tar.gz pip install git+git://github.com/steven-murray/pycamb.git --user

**d)** After the setup script has finished, you should have a copy of the `kids_ggl` executable somewhere in your `$PATH`, which means you can run it out-of-the-box from anywhere in your computer. To make sure, type

        which kids_ggl

If you do not see any message it means the place where the executable is is not part of your `$PATH`. To fix this, look through the installation messages where the file was placed (in my Macbook this place is `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/kids_ggl`) and add the following statement to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` if your terminal shell is `bash`:

        export PATH=${PATH}:<path_to_kids_ggl_folder>

or the following in your `~/.cshrc` or `~/.tcshrc` if your shell is set to `csh` or `tcsh`:

        setenv PATH ${PATH}:<path_to_kids_ggl_folder>

where, in my case, `<path_to_kids_ggl_folder>=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin`.

**e)** You can run an example by typing (see below for details)

    kids_ggl -c demo/ggl_demo_nfw_stack.txt --sampler --demo

This should show three panels with data points and lines resembling the Early Science satellite galaxy-galaxy lensing results of Sifon et al. (2015) and, after closing it, show the 3x3x14 covariance matrix.

####2. Set up your configuration file.
    
See `demo/ggl_demo_nfw_stack.txt` and `demo/ggl_demo_halo_specific.txt` for guidance.


####3. Run! 
There are two major things the pipeline can do for you:

**a)** Measure the lensing signal. To do this, type:

        kids_ggl -c <config_file> --esd

**b)** Estimate halo model parameters from the lensing signal. To do this, type:

        kids_ggl -c <config_file> --sampler

The sampler module has a demo option which you should always try before running a particular model on the data. To this end, type

        kids_ggl -c <config_file> --sampler --demo

This option will generate the ESD(s) for your chosen set of initial parameters, print the chi2/dof on screen, overplot the model to the data points and, once you close this plot, will display the full covariance matrix.


###Some suggestions to make the best of this pipeline:

- Make sure you have tested your model using the demo before you set up a full run!
- After running a demo, run an MCMC chain of your model with as few steps as possible to make sure that the output looks the way you want it to look. Fix anything that you can and report any possible bugs.
- Always check how many cores are available in your machine before running in parallel.
- **Contribute!**
 
If you have any questions, please contact Andrej Dvornik (`dvornik@strw.leidenuniv.nl`), Margot Brouwer (`brouwer@strw.leidenuniv.nl`) and Crist贸bal Sif贸n (`sifon@strw.leidenuniv.nl`).
