**The KiDS Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing pipeline**

``kids_ggl`` works with the KiDS lensing catalog to calculate the
lensing signal around a user-specified lens sample, including the covariance
matrix, and fit a flexible halo model. It also provides some functionality as a
``python`` module as ``kids_ggl_pipeline``.

``kids_ggl`` is compatible with Python 3 as of version 1.6.2.
